## File Structure
We value the concept of [co-location](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/colocation) to keep separation of concern to decrease coupling and increase cohesion for maintainability. So we don't separate directory by technologies, we do by concerns.


## CI/CD
We use [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for CI/CD. It automatically lints, builds, or deploys when you push to a pull request or merge to a certain branch.
